  You can add bs_g_opme
  
NOTE:
if you are upgrading from a previous edition of PTlink services or 
a TAPS release prior to 0.0.1Beta0. And you want to have memoserv
notification enabled by default, you need set notify as default memoserv
options, using:
  ./ircsvs conf SET memoserv.DefaultOptions notify
